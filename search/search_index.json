For instance, in clinical trials, adjusting for covariates is a necessary aspect of the statistical analysis in order to improve the precision of the treatment comparison and to assess effect modification. sAUC is a semi-parametric AUC regression model to compare the effect of two treatment groups in the intended non-normal outcome while adjusting for discrete covariates. More detailed reasons on what it is and why it is proposed are outlined in \nthis paper\n. A major reason behind the development of this method is that this method is computationally simple and is based on closed-form parameter and standard error estimation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel\n\n\nWe consider applications that compare a response variable y between two groups (A and B) while adjusting for k categorical covariates \n\\(X_1,X_2,...,X_k\\)\n. The response variable y is a continuous or ordinal variable that is not normally distributed. Without loss of generality, we assume each covariate is coded such that \n\\(X_i=1,...,n_i\\)\n,for \n\\(i=1,...,k\\)\n. For each combination of the levels of the covariates, we define the Area Under the ROC curve (AUC) in the following way:\n\n\n\\[\\pi_{x_1 x_2...x_k}=P(Y^A>Y^B|X_1=x_1,X_2=x_2,...,X_k=x_k ) + \\]\n\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{2} P(Y^A=Y^B|X_1=x_1,X_2=x_2,...,X_k=x_k ),\\]\n\n\nwhere \n\\(x_1=1,...,n_1,...,x_k=1,...,n_k\\)\n, and \n\\(Y^A\\)\n and \n\\(Y^B\\)\n are two randomly chosen observations from Group A and B, respectively. The second term in the above equation is for the purpose of accounting ties.\n\n\nFor each covariate \n\\(X_i\\)\n, without loss of generality, we use the last category as the reference category and define (\n\\(n_i-1\\)\n) dummy variables \n\\(X_i^{(1)},X_i^{(2)},...,X_i^{(n_i-1)}\\)\n such that\n\n\n\\[X_i^{(j)} (x)= \\left\\{\\begin{array}\n{rrr}\n1, j = x \\\\\n0, j \\ne x,\n\\end{array}\\right.\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \n\\(i=1,...,k; j=1,...,n_i-1; x=1,...,n_i\\)\n. We model the association between AUC \n\\(\\pi_{x_1 x_2...x_k}\\)\n and covariates using a logistic model. Such a model specifies that the logit of \n\\(\\pi_{x_1 x_2...x_k}\\)\n is a linear combination of terms that are products of the dummy variables defined above. Specifically,\n\n\n\\[logit(\\pi_{x_1 x_2...x_k } )=Z_{x_1 x_2...x_k} \\boldsymbol{\\beta},\\]\n\n\nwhere \n\\(Z_{x_1 x_2...x_k}\\)\n is a row vector whose elements are zeroes or ones and are products of \n\\(X_1^{(1)} (x_1 ),...,X_1^{(n_i-1) } (x_1),...,X_k^{(1)} (x_k),...,X_k^{(n_k-1)} (x_k)\\)\n, and \n\\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\)\n is a column vector of nonrandom unknown parameters. Now, define a column vector \n\\(\\pi\\)\n by stacking up \n\\(\\pi_{x_1 x_2...x_k}\\)\n and define a matrix Z by stacking up \n\\(Z_{x_1 x_2...x_k}\\)\n, as \n\\(x_i\\)\n ranges from 1 to \n\\(n_i, i=1,...,k\\)\n, our final model is\n\n\n\\[logit(\\pi)=Z\\boldsymbol{\\beta} ...(1)\\]\n\n\nThe reason for us to use a logit transformation of the AUC instead of using the original AUC is for variance stabilization. We will illustrate the above general model using examples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimation\n\n\nFirst, we denote the number of observations with covariates \n\\(X_1=i_1,...,X_k=i_k\\)\n in groups A and B by \n\\(N_{i_1...i_k}^A\\)\n and \n\\(N_{i_1...i_k}^B\\)\n, respectively. We assume both \n\\(N_{i_1...i_k}^A\\)\n and \n\\(N_{i_1...i_k}^B\\)\n are greater than zero in the following development. An unbiased estimator of \n\\(\\pi_{i_1...i_k}\\)\n proposed by Mann and Whitney (1947) is\n\n\n\\[\\hat{\\pi}_{i_1...i_k}=\\frac{\\sum_{l=1}^{N_{i_1...i_k}^A} \\sum_{j=1}^{N_{i_1...i_k}^B} I_{lj}}{N_{i_1...i_k}^A N_{i_1...i_k}^B},\\]\n\n\nwhere\n\n\n\\[I_{i_1... i_k; lj}= \\left\\{\\begin{array}\n{rrr}\n1, Y_{i_1...i_k; l}^A>Y_{i_1...i_k; j}^B \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2}, Y_{i_1...i_k; l}^A=Y_{i_1...i_k; j}^B \\\\\n0, Y_{i_1...i_k; l}^A<Y_{i_1...i_k; j}^B\n\\end{array}\\right.\n\\]\n\n\nand \n\\(Y_{i_1...i_k; l}^A\\)\n and \n\\(Y_{i_1...i_k; j}^B\\)\n are observations with \n\\(X_1=i_1,...,X_k=i_k\\)\n in groups A and B, respectively. Delong, Delong and Clarke-Pearson (1988) have shown that\n\n\n\\[\\hat{\\pi}_{i_1...i_k} \\approx N(\\pi_{i_1...i_k},\\sigma_{i_1...i_k}^2).\\]\n\n\nIn order to obtain an estimator for \n\\(\\sigma_{i_1...i_k}^2\\)\n, they first computed\n\n\n\\[V_{i_1...i_k; l}^A=\\frac{1}{N_{i_1...i_k}^B } \\sum_{j=1}^{N_{i_1...i_k}^B} I_{lj},    l=1,...,N_{i_1...i_k}^A\\]\n\n\nand\n\n\n\\[V_{i_1...i_k;j}^B=\\frac{1}{N_{i_1...i_k}^A } \\sum_{l=1}^{N_{i_1...i_k}^A} I_{lj},     j=1,...,N_{i_1...i_k}^B\\]\n\n\nThen, an estimate of the variance of the nonparametric AUC was\n\n\n\\[\\hat{\\sigma}_{i_1...i_k}^2=\\frac{(s_{i_1...i_k}^A )^2}{N_{i_1...i_k}^A} + \\frac{(s_{i_1...i_k}^B )^2}{N_{i_1...i_k}^B},\\]\n\n\nwhere\n\n\n\\((s_{i_1...i_k}^A )^2\\)\n and \n\\((s_{i_1...i_k}^B )^2\\)\n were the sample variances of\n\n\n\\(V_{i_1...i_k; l}^A; l=1,...,N_{i_1...i_k}^A\\)\n and \n\\(V_{i_1...i_k; j}^B; j=1,...,N_{i_1...i_k}^B,\\)\n respectively. Clearly, we need both \n\\(N_{i_1...i_k}^A\\)\n and \n\\(N_{i_1...i_k}^B\\)\n are greater than two in order to compute \n\\(\\hat{\\sigma}_{i_1...i_k}^2\\)\n.\n\n\nNow, in order to estimate parameters in Model (1), we first derive the asymptotic variance of \n\\(\\hat{\\gamma}_{i_1...i_k}\\)\n using the delta method, which results in\n\n\n\\[\\hat{\\gamma}_{i_1...i_k}=logit(\\hat{\\pi}_{i_1...i_k}) \\approx N(logit(\\pi_{i_1...i_k}),\\tau_{i_1...i_k}^2),\\]\n\n\nwhere \n\\[\\hat{\\tau}_{i_1...i_k}^2=\\frac{\\hat{\\gamma}_{i_1...i_k}^2}{\\hat{\\pi}_{i_1...i_k}^2  (1-\\hat{\\pi}_{i_1...i_k})^2}\\]\n\n\nRewriting the above model, we obtain\n\n\n\\[\\hat{\\gamma}_{i_1...i_k}=logit(\\pi_{i_1...i_k }) =Z_{i_1...i_k} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\epsilon_{i_1...i_k}\\]\n\n\nwhere,\n\n\n\\(\\epsilon_{i_1,...,i_k} \\approx N(0,\\tau_{i_1,...,i_k}^2)\\)\n. Then, by stacking up the \n\\(\\hat{\\gamma}_{1_i,...,i_k}\\)\n to be \n\\(\\hat{\\gamma}, Z_{i_1...i_k}\\)\n to be \n\\(\\boldsymbol{Z}\\)\n, and \n\\(\\epsilon_{i_1,...,i_k}\\)\n to be \n\\(\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\\)\n, we have\n\n\n\\[\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\gamma}} =logit \\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\pi}} = \\boldsymbol{Z\\beta + \\epsilon},\\]\n\n\nwhere, \n\\(E(\\epsilon)=0\\)\n and \n\\(\\hat{T}=Var(\\epsilon)=diag(\\hat{\\tau}_{i_1... i_k}^2)\\)\n which is a diagonal matrix. Finally, by using the generalized least squares method, we estimate the parameters \u03b2 and its variance-covariance matrix as follows;\n\n\n\\[\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\beta} ={(\\hat{Z}^T  \\hat{T}^{-1}  Z)}^{-1} Z^T  \\hat{T}^{-1} \\hat{\\gamma}}\\]\n\n\nand \n\\[\\hat{V}(\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\beta}}) = \\boldsymbol{(\\hat{Z}^T  \\hat{T}^{-1}  Z)}^{-1}\\]\n\n\nThe above equations can be used to construct a 100(1-\u03b1)% Wald confidence intervals for \n\\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta_i}\\)\n using formula\n\n\n\\[\\hat{\\beta}_i \\pm Z_{1-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}} \\sqrt{\\hat{V}(\\hat{\\beta}_i)},\\]\n\n\nwhere \n\\(Z_{1-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}}\\)\n is the \n\\((1-\\frac{\\alpha}{2})^{th}\\)\n quantile of the standard normal distribution. Equivalently, we reject\n\n\n\\(H_0:\\beta_i = 0\\)\n if \n\\(|\\hat{\\beta}_i| > Z_{1-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}} \\sqrt{\\hat{V}(\\hat{\\beta}_i)},\\)\n\n\nThe p-value for testing \n\\(H_0\\)\n is \n\\(2 * P(Z > |\\hat{\\beta}_i|/\\sqrt{\\hat{V}\\hat{\\beta}_i}),\\)\n\n\nwhere Z is a random variable with the standard normal distribution.\n\n\nNow, the total number of cells (combinations of covariates \n\\(X_1,...,X_k\\)\n is \n\\(n_1 n_2...n_k\\)\n. As mentioned earlier, for a cell to be usable in the estimation, the cell needs to have at least two observations from Group A and two observations from Group B. As long as the total number of usable cells is larger than the dimension of \n\\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\)\n, then the matrix \n\\({\\boldsymbol{\\hat{Z}^T \\hat{T}^{-1} Z}}\\)\n is invertible and consequently,\n\\(\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\beta}}\\)\n is computable and model (1) is identifiable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n// add bootstrap table styles to pandoc tables\nfunction bootstrapStylePandocTables() {\n  $('tr.header').parent('thead').parent('table').addClass('table table-condensed');\n}\n$(document).ready(function () {\n  bootstrapStylePandocTables();\n});\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  (function () {\n    var script = document.createElement(\"script\");\n    script.type = \"text/javascript\";\n    script.src  = \"https://mathjax.rstudio.com/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML\";\n    document.getElementsByTagName(\"head\")[0].appendChild(script);\n  })();",

One of the study objectives was to evaluate effects of FASD education brochures with different types of information and visual images on FASD related knowledge, attitudes, and alcohol consumption on childbearing-aged women. The study was conducted in two regions in Russia including St.\u00a0Petersburg (SPB) and the Nizhny Novgorod Region (NNR) from 2005 to 2008. A total of 458 women were recruited from women\u2019s clinics and were randomly assigned to one of three groups (defined by the GROUP variable): (1) a printed FASD prevention brochure with positive images and information stated in a positive way, positive group (PG), (2) a FASD education brochure with negative messages and vivid images, negative group (NG); and (3) a general health material, control group (CG). For the purpose of the analysis in this thesis, only women in the PG and CG were included. Data were obtained from the study principal investigators . The response variable was the change in the number of drinks per day (CHANGE_DRINK=number of drinks after-number of drinks before) on average in the last 30 days from one-month follow-up to baseline. Two covariates considered for the proposed method were \u201cIn the last 30 days, have you smoked cigarettes?\u201d (SMOKE) and \u201cIn the last 30 days, did you take any other vitamins?\u201d (OVITAMIN). Both covariates had \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d as the two levels. The question of interest here was to assess the joint predictive effects of SMOKE and OVITAMIN on whether the participants reduced the number of drinks per day from baseline to one month follow-up period. A total of 210 women with no missing data on any of the CHANGE_DRINK, SMOKE, GROUP, and OVITAMIN were included in the analysis.\n\n\nThe response variable CHANGE_DRINK was heavily skewed and not normally distributed in each group (Shapiro-Wilk p<0.001). Therefore, we decided to use the AUG regression model to analyze the data. In the AUG regression model we define \n\\[\\large \\pi = p(Y_{CG} > Y_{PG})\\]\n Note that the value of \n\\(\\large \\pi\\)\n greater than .5 means that women in the PG had a greater reduction of alcohol drinks than those in the CG. For statistical results, all p-values < .05 were considered statistically significant and 95% CIs were presented.\n\n\nWe first fit an AUC regression model including both main effects of the covariates. Note that the main effects of the covariates in fact represented their interactions with the GROUP variable, which is different than the linear or generalized linear model frame. The reason is that the GROUP variable is involved in defining the AUC. Tables below present the parameter estimates, SEs, p-values, and 95% CIs for model with one and two covariates. Because parameter \n\\(\\beta_2\\)\n was not significantly different from 0, we dropped OVITAMIN and fit another model including only the SMOKE main effect.Table below shows a significant interaction between SMOKE and GROUP because the SMOKE was statistically significant (95% CI: (0.06, 1.47)). Therefore, the final model was \n\\[logit(\\hat{\\pi}_{Smoke}) = \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1}*I(Smoke =Yes)\\]\n. Because the interaction between SMOKE and GROUP was significant, we need to use AUC as a measure of the GROUP effect on CHANGE_DRINK for smokers and non-smokers separately using following formula for example for smokers;\n\n\n\\[\\hat{\\pi}_{Smoke} = \\frac{e^{\\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1}*Smoke =Yes}}{1 + e^{\\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1}*Smoke =Yes}} \\]\n Specifically, the AUCs were 0.537 (insignificant) and 0.713 (significant) for non-smokers and smokers, respectively. This implies that the effect of positive and control brochures were similar for nonsmokers; however, for smokers, the probability that the positive brochure had a better effect than the control brochure in terms of alcohol reduction is 71.30%, indicating the positive brochure is a better option than the control brochure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResult of sAUC Regression with one discrete covariate\n\n\nfrom pandas import read_csv\nfrom saucpy import sAUC\n\n# Data analysis\nfasd = read_csv(\"../saucpy/data/fasd.csv\")\nfasd['group'] = fasd['group'].astype('category')\nfasd['x1']    = fasd['x1'].astype('category')\nfasd['x2']    = fasd['x2'].astype('category')\n\nsAUC.semiparametricAUC(response = \"y\", treatment_group = [\"group\"], input_covariates = [\"x1\"], data = fasd)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel Summary: one predictor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPredictors\n\n\nCoefficients\n\n\nStd.

One of the study objectives was to evaluate effects of FASD education brochures with different types of information and visual images on FASD related knowledge, attitudes, and alcohol consumption on childbearing-aged women. The study was conducted in two regions in Russia including St.\u00a0Petersburg (SPB) and the Nizhny Novgorod Region (NNR) from 2005 to 2008. A total of 458 women were recruited from women\u2019s clinics and were randomly assigned to one of three groups (defined by the GROUP variable): (1) a printed FASD prevention brochure with positive images and information stated in a positive way, positive group (PG), (2) a FASD education brochure with negative messages and vivid images, negative group (NG); and (3) a general health material, control group (CG). For the purpose of the analysis in this thesis, only women in the PG and CG were included. Data were obtained from the study principal investigators . The response variable was the change in the number of drinks per day (CHANGE_DRINK=number of drinks after-number of drinks before) on average in the last 30 days from one-month follow-up to baseline. Two covariates considered for the proposed method were \u201cIn the last 30 days, have you smoked cigarettes?\u201d (SMOKE) and \u201cIn the last 30 days, did you take any other vitamins?\u201d (OVITAMIN). Both covariates had \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d as the two levels. The question of interest here was to assess the joint predictive effects of SMOKE and OVITAMIN on whether the participants reduced the number of drinks per day from baseline to one month follow-up period. A total of 210 women with no missing data on any of the CHANGE_DRINK, SMOKE, GROUP, and OVITAMIN were included in the analysis.\n\n\nThe response variable CHANGE_DRINK was heavily skewed and not normally distributed in each group (Shapiro-Wilk p<0.001). Therefore, we decided to use the AUG regression model to analyze the data. In the AUG regression model we define \n\\[\\large \\pi = p(Y_{CG} > Y_{PG})\\]\n Note that the value of \n\\(\\large \\pi\\)\n greater than .5 means that women in the PG had a greater reduction of alcohol drinks than those in the CG. For statistical results, all p-values < .05 were considered statistically significant and 95% CIs were presented.\n\n\nWe first fit an AUC regression model including both main effects of the covariates. Note that the main effects of the covariates in fact represented their interactions with the GROUP variable, which is different than the linear or generalized linear model frame. The reason is that the GROUP variable is involved in defining the AUC. Tables below present the parameter estimates, SEs, p-values, and 95% CIs for model with one and two covariates. Because parameter \n\\(\\beta_2\\)\n was not significantly different from 0, we dropped OVITAMIN and fit another model including only the SMOKE main effect.Table below shows a significant interaction between SMOKE and GROUP because the SMOKE was statistically significant (95% CI: (0.05, 1.47)). Therefore, the final model was \n\\[logit(\\hat{\\pi}_{Smoke}) = \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1}*I(Smoke =Yes)\\]\n. Because the interaction between SMOKE and GROUP was significant, we need to use AUC as a measure of the GROUP effect on CHANGE_DRINK for smokers and non-smokers separately using following formula for example for smokers;\n\n\n\\[\\hat{\\pi}_{Smoke} = \\frac{e^{\\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1}*Smoke =Yes}}{1 + e^{\\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_1}*Smoke =Yes}} \\]\n\n\nSpecifically, the AUCs were 0.537 (insignificant) and 0.713 (significant) for non-smokers and smokers, respectively. This implies that the effect of positive and control brochures were similar for nonsmokers; however, for smokers, the probability that the positive brochure had a better effect than the control brochure in terms of alcohol reduction is 71.30%, indicating the positive brochure is a better option than the control brochure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResult of sAUC Regression with one discrete covariate\n\n\nusing DataFrames\nusing SemiparametricAUC\n\n# Data analysis examples\nfasd = DataFrames.readtable(joinpath(Pkg.dir(\"SemiparametricAUC\"), \"data/fasd.csv\"))\n# fasd = readtable(\"ds.csv\")\n\n# Define factor/categorical variable\nfunction convert_to_factor(x)\n    return(DataFrames.pool(x))\nend\n\nfasd[:group] = convert_to_factor(fasd[:group])\nfasd[:x1]    = convert_to_factor(fasd[:x1])\nfasd[:x2]    = convert_to_factor(fasd[:x2])\n# fasd[:x3]  = convert_to_factor(fasd[:x3])\n\none_covariates_results = SemiparametricAUC.semiparametricAUC(model_formula = y ~ x1, treatment_group = :group, data = fasd)\none_covariates_results\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel Summary: one discrete covariate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPredictors\n\n\nEstimate\n\n\n2.5%\n\n\n97.5%\n\n\nStd.
